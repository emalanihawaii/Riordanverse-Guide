      <h2>Getting Started</h2>
      <p><b>This is everything you need to know to get you started at Camp Nexus!</b><br>Riordanverse is a Multi Pantheon based RP Server that includes all Pantheons from the Riordanverse. We have brought together Greek, Roman, Norse, Egyptian, and now Celtic Pantheons in one camp for everyone. The Nexus of Gods was created after the events of Percy Jackson and takes place 50 some years in the future where all of the Pantheons have come together in one camp. Camp Nexus is based in Ohio. The <i>About World</i> tab explains more about this Camp and how it started.</p>

        <h3>The Nexus of Gods</h3>
        <p>So basic rule of thumb on all this: everything before the start of this lore is assumed to be from Riordan’s books. The roleplay takes place fifty-five years after the end of Trials of Apollo (yes there will be spoilers).
          <br><br>
          As events moved forwards, little Estelle Blofis grew up hearing stories of the gods. Her mother and father told her countless stories of her older brother, Percy Jackson, and even when she was young she wanted to meet these gods. Percy came to visit often as he could, and he would tell of other gods as well. The Egyptians, the Norse, the Greeks, all of the ones he knew of. Estelle was a smart girl, and she soaked up the knowledge as if she was a sponge in water. So when it came time for little Estele to graduate from highschool, she knew exactly what she wanted to do: build a paradise for demigods. Her vision started small. She talked with Chiron, and he got in touch with Zeus, Horus, and Odin, and together the three sat down with this mortal woman whom they knew was related to the savior of Olympus.
          <br><br>
          Fast forward ten years, and Estelle makes a big break in bringing the pantheons together. She buys a large plot of land in southern Ohio, and begins work on the ultimate merging. Getting help from the gods, who also wish to put millenia of separation aside, it only takes two years complete the conjoined camp, which Estelle names the Nexus of the Gods. The area shows up on maps and even online, but thanks to the blessing of the gods, mortals are rarely allowed inside, nor can see the actual structures. Twenty-one years later, it is now the year 2069, and the Nexus of the Gods is still going strong, with Estelle Bofis as the de facto leader of the camps. While she has no say in the godly side of things, she does handle business as well as who is and who is not allowed into the camp.
          <br><br>
          While it took some time for all the pantheons’ children to come together, the Nexus of the Gods is finally a place where demigods and magicians from any god can come and live. Each camp is an exact replica of the originals, with the Egyptian camp being custom made by Isis and other Egyptian gods to provide everything a magician may need. The Norse camp is slightly different, as their area is simply an entry point to Valhalla. Norse symbols were drawn into a large stone by Odin himself, allowing the Bifrost to connect there rather than it’s usual spot in Boston. Emissaries have been sent to and from each camp to communicate. In the very center of where all the camps meet sits the New Alexandrian Library, commissioned by Annabeth Chase, and set up by Athena,Thoth, and Odin, where knowledge from every pantheon is gathered and shared equally. Every myth, every legend, every story. Information on every god, titan, and primordial deity known to mortals rests here. The heroics of Percy Jackson and the demigods from the Prophecy of Seven. The Kane Chronicles and the history of Magnus Chase, son of Frey. And in her own little office sits the Oracle of Delphi and sacred maiden to Phoebus Apollo, a beautiful young woman by the name of Alexa Hunter. It is her job to give out prophecies and quests to the Greeks, Romans, and the Egyptians equally (the Norse get theirs from the Nornir, or the Norse Fates.
          <br><br>
          And so, just as the great Lester Papadopolous once said, Estelle Blofis would one day grow up to rule the world. What he didn’t know was that it would be the world of the gods rather than of Man….</p>

        <h3>Demigod Technology</h3>
        <p>Through the years technology of the mortals has evolved. Taking inspiration from the reknowned Avengers movies, humans recreated the technology that Tony Stark uses. Holographic screens and devices are so commonplace, it is hard to find something else nowadays. Even inside the Nexus, they are used everywhere. Phones have seemed to be the only exception, given their design and purpose.
          <br><br>
          For years, demigods could not use a cell phone or internet without attracting monsters to them (even though it was Lord Hermes that created the internet). Twenty-eight years ago, that changed, when two Greek demigods, brothers of the same mortal woman, discovered how to avoid this. Johnathan and Nexus Rung were geniuses in their own right, and together they developed the demigod technology you use today. Johnathan was a son of Hephaestus, and using his skills and power, he designed the casing and workings of the technology. Nexus was a son of Apollo, and with his skills and power of music and speech, he discovered the special frequency that can deter monsters. Together they built the first demigod phone, and tested it thoroughly. Today, we still use their designs in making technology to keep up with the mortals. Johnathan and Nexus were both granted godhood for their great achievement, and remain immortal to this day, hopefully still making newer technology. Johnathan became known as the God of Modern Technology and Energy, while Nexus became known as the God of Sound. </p>

        <h3>The Gods</h3>
        <p>At the start of 2069 (the new year) the Nexus finished a short but hard-won war. At the end of it, the false god Aracçyon was destroyed, and the line of Kane became singular. The gods destroyed Aracçyon, previously known as Alexander Kane, the son of Amos Kane, and from his ashes was formed Develra, the Patron of the Nexus of the Gods. He now protects the Nexus, able to use all magic and knowledge from his previous form. He now resides in the Camp Nexus Center in his own cottage sized house.
          <br><br>
        Another result from the war with the false god was that the gods of the other pantheons realized how much they had been apart from their children, and decided to rectify that. It has started with small visits, but in time the gods will be wandering through the Nexus like normal residents.</p>
