<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>
  <b>This is everything you need to know to get you started at Camp Nexus!</b><br>Riordanverse is a Multi Pantheon based RP Server that includes all Pantheons from the Riordanverse. We have brought together Greek, Roman, Norse, Egyptian, and now Celtic Pantheons in one camp for everyone. The Nexus of Gods was created after the events of Percy Jackson and takes place 50 some years in the future where all of the Pantheons have come together in one camp. Camp Nexus is based in Ohio. The <i>About World</i> tab explains more about this Camp and how it started.
