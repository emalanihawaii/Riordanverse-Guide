  <h3>Blessings of the Gods</h3>
  <p>
    <b>To receive a Blessing you must Apply with The Blessings of The Gods Application from the <i>documents</i> tab. Submit the form in applications and list your quest reason as “Trial of (deity)”. Ping the admin team for approval. You can also go to bot god list channel and ping the specific admin of the god you need as well, just in case.</b>
  <br>
    <br>
    <i>Note: Blessings can only be given by an Admin playing a god. In order to receive a blessing, one must pass a trial of the god in question. Trials may be conducted by any admin, at any time. Simply ask and it will discussed if you are worthy. There is great risk of injury and failure of the trial MAY lead to death of your character, so this is not to be taken lightly.</i>
    <br>
    <br>
    Should you succeed in your quest and receive the blessing, you will be allowed to select one more power from your GP tier list if you are taking the trial of your GP, or enhance a crossover power if not. The results of the trial may change at the discretion of an admin. Please discuss any questions you have concerning your trial/blessing with an Admin beforehand, so as to eliminate confusion in the trial itself.

  <h3>The Blessing System</h3>
  <p>
    After completion of a trial to gain the blessing of a god, select one ability from your chosen deity to enhance. If you are the child of the deity that you have taken the trial of, see the exclusive powers above (or choose another power from the tier list).

  <h3>Blessings in General</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Receive a magical item/weapon (within reason)</li>
    <li>Enhance one of your own powers that corresponds to the god of the trial (within reason and must be connected) This is done using the crossover abilities list. The ability you choose must correspond to Your godly parent in some way. </li>
    <li>Pick a “Special” Ability from the Designated list for your godly Parent OR another ability from your Godly Parents Power List. </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Weapons/Magical Items Blessings</h3>
  <p>
    If you are unable to find an ability that works with both your parent god or goddess and your blessing god or goddess then you will be given the ability to choose a weapon or magic item. There have been many examples in the books that would be similar to. For example from Athena, an invisibility cap or Reyna’s cloak although both of these are very powerful so the challenge would be extremely difficult.
