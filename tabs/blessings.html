  <h3>Blessings of the Gods</h3>
  <p>
    <b>To receive a Blessing you must Apply with The Blessings of The Gods Application from the <i>documents</i> tab. Submit the form in applications and list your quest reason as “Trial of (deity)”. Ping the admin team for approval. You can also go to bot god list channel and ping the specific admin of the god you need as well, just in case.</b>
  <br>
    <br>
    <i>Note: Blessings can only be given by an Admin playing a god. In order to receive a blessing, one must pass a trial of the god in question. Trials may be conducted by any admin, at any time. Simply ask and it will discussed if you are worthy. There is great risk of injury and failure of the trial MAY lead to death of your character, so this is not to be taken lightly.</i>
    <br>
    <br>
    Should you succeed in your quest and receive the blessing, you will be allowed to select one more power from your GP tier list if you are taking the trial of your GP, or enhance a crossover power if not. The results of the trial may change at the discretion of an admin. Please discuss any questions you have concerning your trial/blessing with an Admin beforehand, so as to eliminate confusion in the trial itself.

  <h3>The Blessing System</h3>
  <p>
    After completion of a trial to gain the blessing of a god, select one ability from your chosen deity to enhance. If you are the child of the deity that you have taken the trial of, see the exclusive powers above (or choose another power from the tier list).
  </p>
</div>
<div class = "cat" id = "General">
  <h3>Blessings in General</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Receive a magical item/weapon (within reason)</li>
    <li>Enhance one of your own powers that corresponds to the god of the trial (within reason and must be connected) This is done using the crossover abilities list. The ability you choose must correspond to Your godly parent in some way. </li>
    <li>Pick a “Special” Ability from the Designated list for your godly Parent OR another ability from your Godly Parents Power List. </li>
  </ul>

<div class = "cat" id = "Weapons">
  <h3>Weapons/Magical Items Blessings</h3>
  <p>
    If you are unable to find an ability that works with both your parent god or goddess and your blessing god or goddess then you will be given the ability to choose a weapon or magic item. There have been many examples in the books that would be similar to. For example from Athena, an invisibility cap or Reyna’s cloak although both of these are very powerful so the challenge would be extremely difficult.

  <h3>Legacy Information and Rules</h3>
  <h4>History and Description</h4>
  <p>Legacies started in the Roman Camp Jupiter, and it is when a demigod has children. Those childen and their children so on are called legacies. For each generation of a legacy (parent-to-child), the powers of the godly parents grow weaker.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>First generation</b> of legacy is the direct child of a god. A good example would be Percy, who is the son of Poseidon, making him the first generation of the sea god’s children. First generation have all the standard abilities from the powers lists (following the rules of said list, naturally)</li>
    <li><b>Second generation</b> legacy would be the grandchild of the god, so if Percy had a child, that children would be a second generation legacy. Second gen legacies inherit most abilities from the god they descend from, with the except of the single powerful ability in the powers lists. In most cases, the abilities of the legacy are the same as their first generation, though differences can occur.</li>
    <li><b>Third generation </b>legacy would be the great-grandchild of the godly ancestor. Their powers would be more diluted than the previous generation, meaning you can only pick one category from the powers list. If only one category exists, then you get the whole category, but the powers are weaker than a normal demigod’s.</li>
    <li><b>Fourth generation</b> legacies inherit only one ability from the godly ancestor.</li>
    <li><b>Fifth generation</b> & below Legacies will only receive the “General Ability” excluding wing abilities</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <p><b>ONLY SECOND GEN AND FIFTH OR FURTHER GEN COMBINATION IS ALLOWED</b> In the case of two legacies mixing (As in, a godly ancestor and a godly parent for one demigod), the demigod inherits the stats of whatever generation legacy they are, as well as full abilities of the first generation.</p>
  <br>
  <p>While rare, it is possible for cross-pantheon legacies, so one may be a legacy of Greco-Roman, while also a child of a Norse god, or vice versa. Due to certain restrictions, one cannot be a legacy of a god and blood of the pharaoh’s.</p>
  <h4>Additional</h4>
  <p>To be a double legacy (godly ancestor and godly parent) your legacies must be at least 3 generations apart. So if you are 1st gen, your godly ancestor must be 4th gen, etc.</p>
