<h2>Magician Abilities</h2>
<div class = "cat">
  <h3>General Abilities</h3>
  <p>All godly paths can learn any number of divine words/words of power, however it takes more practice then powers on the power list. All godly paths can also learn how to use the duat (duat travel, duat sight, duat lockers, etc.), however it takes more practice to learn.All godly path can make shabti and charms however it is very hard to do properly.All godly paths can learn how to do combat avatars but it’s by far the hardest out of the four (unless specified on your list).</p>
  <br>
  <p>In a slightly different turn of overall powers are the parts of the soul. All magician’s have one and have some control over their own. The thing that will come up the most is your Ba. With practice you can control what it looks like, where you go, and when it is trigger. This can be overridden though by a person more powerful than you and can have consequences.</p>
