    <h3>Basics</h3>
    <p>The Hunters of Artemis are the followers of the moon goddess. They tend to stay in their camp unless sent to CHB or CJ by Artemis/Diana. They are also all partially immortal unless they fall in battle. To become a hunter one must not identify as a male, and recite the oath:“I pledge myself to the Goddess Artemis/Diana. I turn my back on the company of men, accept eternal maidenhood, and join the Hunt.” By swearing this oath they become immortal as long as they do not break their vows or die in combat.</p>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The Hunters of Artemis are maidens (which can be human, god, demigod, or nymph) who have sworn loyalty to the maiden goddess Artemis/Diana to join her in the Hunt and reject love for as long as they live. They gain eternal youth as long as they don't break their vows. Each hunter also recieves a silver bow and arrows, silver hunting knives, and the Hunt uniform upon joining the Hunt.</p>

    <p>The Hunters of Artemis immensely enjoy hunting monsters and whatever else they see fit at Artemis's side. They are her maidservants, her companions, and her sisters in arms. Usually, only about twenty of the Hunters accompanied Artemis at a time, while the remaining girls engaged in their own activities at the current location of the Hunt. They are usually accompanied by animals that will help them hunt, such as wolves and hunting birds. As the protector of maidens, Artemis would punish men who dare to lay eyes on her Hunters. Additionally, because of their oath, many of the Hunters have become so isolated from males that they have come to distrust them, dreading even travelling with them, as seen in The Titan's Curse and The Last Olympian, though there have been a few males that were accepted into the Hunt. However, some hunters like Thalia Grace are completely fine with travelling with men.</p>

    <h3>Oath to Artemis</h3>
    <p>If a maiden wants to become a Hunter, she must recite the oath. Once Artemis agrees to that oath, it is binding and the Hunter must live by it for the rest of their days. If a Hunter falls in love, Artemis will remove their immortality and may turn them into an animal, depending on her discretion. As implied in The Burning Maze, Artemis does not allow Lesbian relationships within the hunt either.</p>

    <p>Shortly after her birth, Artemis requests to be taken to Olympus to see her father Zeus. He swears on the River Styx to grant her anything for her birthday. Among others, she asks for a group of all-female followers, marking the beginning of the Hunters. After acquiring a bow and arrows from the Cyclopes and a pack of hunting dogs from Pan, Artemis assembles her group of followers. Many mortal girls and nymphs were delighted at the idea of living freely in the wilderness without being married off or courted by lovesick gods.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Desiring a herd of golden deer to pull her chariot, Artemis gathered the Hunters to assist in capturing them. Britomartis, a demigod who Artemis would later reward as a minor goddess known as the "Lady of Nets", sets snares and concealed nets to capture their prey. The other Hunters make noise to lure out the golden deer, and as expected, four of them charge straight into the traps. The fifth runs off to safety and is given Artemis' blessing.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Artemis punished several men who dared to lay eyes on her Hunters. Actaeon was one such man who fell victim to Artemis' wrath. After a hard day of hunting, he stumbles upon Artemis and the Hunters bathing one night. Falling in love at the sight of Artemis, he reveals his presence to the goddess and insists that she marry him. Angered by his words, Artemis transforms Actaeon into a deer and rouses his own fifty hunting dogs from their sleep to tear their master apart.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Another day, a boy named Sipriotes catches Artemis bathing one time. Begging for mercy not to meet a fate similar to that of Actaeon, he is instead changed into a female by Artemis, who offered him the choice of death or gender change. Having accepted the latter, Sipriotes then joins the Hunters.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Artemis' favorite Hunter was Kallisto, who accidentally attracted the attention of Zeus. While she was separated from the other Hunters, Zeus appeared to her in the form of Artemis herself. He attempts to seduce Kallisto, but when she rejects his advances, he reveals his true form and has his way with her. Ashamed of what had happened, Kallisto attempts to keep the encounter with Zeus a secret. Her pregnancy is exposed, however, when the Hunters go swimming in a lake one day. Angered by her father's actions but unable to forgive Kallisto for lying to her, Artemis sadly transforms her former best friend into a bear, warning Kallisto that the next time they meet she will have to kill her.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Following this incident, Artemis befriends the giant Orion on the island of Delos. Impressed by his hunting skills, she allows Orion to join as the first ever male Hunter. Soon, he and Artemis become close friends, so much so that Apollo fears his twin sister would be renouncing her oath of maidenhood. He inflicts insanity upon Orion, who starts hunting all animals he finds. This rouses the mother earth Gaea from her sleep and counters by sending a giant scorpion to kill Orion. When Artemis finally found Orion's corpse, she honored him in the stars as a constellation with the scorpion nearby, thereby immortalizing his story. In some myths Apollo challenges Artemis to a archery competition with Orion disguised as a rock.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The last male to join the Hunt was Hippolytos, a handsome prince who had no interest in romance whatsoever. For this reason, he incurred the wrath of Aphrodite. When Hippolytos visited his father, King Theseus of Athens, Aphrodite heightened their anger during an argument, resulting in Theseus drawing his sword and striking his son dead. When Artemis received word of this, she immediately rushed to Hippolytos' tomb and took his body to her nephew Asclepius, the best physician in all of Greece. Using the Physician's Cure, Asclepius brings Hippolytos back to life. She then takes Hippolytos to Italy, where he becomes a priest of one of her sacred shrines and lives to old age.</p>
