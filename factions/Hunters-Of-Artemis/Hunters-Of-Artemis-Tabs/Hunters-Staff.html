  <p><b>Journey to the Nexus:</b></p>

    She was there when the nexus was constructed and has traveled there instead of the Camp Half Blood in NY ever since.

  <p><b>Extra Backstory:</b></p>
  <p id = "i">
    When I was young my mom and I were attacked by a Hydra.  My mom got hit and told me to run into the forest where I would be safe.  I said “No, mom I don’t want to leave you.”  She just looked up at me and smiled one last time saying, “Go Arcadia you must be safe you are going to be very important someday.  I love you.”  So, I finally gave in and ran.  After what felt like hours of running but was only 4 or 5 minutes I stumbled upon a clearing with a hollow tree at the center.  That is where I finally collapsed crying for my mother.  It was there that I met Artemis and joined the hunt.  About 500 years ago Artemis adopted me using a blood ritual so I became her flesh and blood.  During the Giant war she was captured by Orion who had sworn revenge on Artemis and tried to have it by attempting to r*pe her blood daughter from this incident she carries scars on her back that say Property of Orion.  She has constant nightmares about this though.  After the incident due to her experiences she had tried to cut out the sad feeling by causing herself pain by c*tting on her forearms causing permanent scarring. Arcadia generally keeps to herself about her personal stuff, and is more or less only discussing work with people when talking with them.
