  <li>Ard Tiarna - Natalia</li>
    <li class = "l2">High Lord of the Celtic Pantheon residing at the Nexus, the Ard Tiarna is responsible for the well being of all campers under their protection.  They are just one of many appointed by the gods to watch over the Celtic demigods in a certain sector; the Ard Tiarna also appoints the Tighearnas of the camp to serve as overseers. In major decisions, their vote is often the deciding one, although it is possible to be overruled with a majority.</li>
  <li>Tighearnas - See bottom of page</li>
    <li class = "l2">Lord of the Celtic Pantheon residing at the Nexus. Tighearnas are appointed at the discretion of the Ard Tiarna, although they must be sufficiently capable of protecting their fellow campers and carrying out leadership duties to even be considered for this position. They oversee the smaller units of the Celtic Faction and aid in making decisions.</li>
