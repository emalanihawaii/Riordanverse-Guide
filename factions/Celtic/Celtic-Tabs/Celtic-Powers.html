  <h3>Dagda</h3>
  <p>
    <b>General Ability - </b>Insight
    <br>
    Children of Dagda have increased wisdom, knowledge, and quick thinking, due to their godly parent being the god of Wisdom
    <br>
    <b>Pick 3:</b>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Light of Life</li>
      <li class = "l2">Children of Dagda can sense the life forces of others. This does not include the sense of someone’s imminent death; rather, it allows a child of Dagda to sense the strength of a life force or the weakness of it. They are also able to know mortals from demigods or others without seeing the person.</li>
    <li>Aura Reader</li>
      <li class = "l2">Children of Dagda are able to see the auras of others. It manifests in different ways depending on the child, such as being able to tell someone’s mood from their aura, or understand intentions based on auras. Some are even able to tell the emotions of someone based on their aura alone.</li>
    <li>Emotional Manipulation</li>
      <li class = "l2">Children of Dagda have the ability to create emotions in others or force other emotions on someone. They can also intensify current emotions that someone is feeling to an overwhelming level, or use emotions to sway people into doing what they want.</li>
    <li>Voice of Reason</li>
      <li class = "l2">Children of Dagda can make weaker-minded people see the logic in their side. This ability is not as strong as charmspeak, and more easily shaken off, but can still be used as a form of magical persuasion.</li>
    <li>Spellcaster</li>
      <li class = "l2">Children of Dagda have spellcasting abilities related to wisdom, energy, earth, and plants. This includes spells related to draining someone mentally, making them sleep, and anything with herbs or plants. They are unable to perform any actual spells or enchantments, however.</li>
    <li>Siphon</li>
      <li class = "l2">Children of Dagda have access to a form of magic that does not need any ingredients or help. They can simply drain someone of their energy to the point of near-sleep or at the very least passing out. The energy goes to them, and, unlike any other spell, both parties are affected. This can also be done in reverse where they can give someone else their energy as well, but this is very hard to do and requires lots of training.</li>
    <li>Fruitful</li>
      <li class = "l2">Children of Dagda have the ability to increase fertility around plants, but are unable to grow plants or control them. They can also revive plants completely from death should the plant die. This ability is strongest in fruit plants and trees</li>

  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Corvid Call</li>
      <li class = "l2">Children of Morrigan are able to speak to crows and ravens via spoken tongue, as both birds are related to death and prophecy. They will also be recognized and loved by these birds as children of Morrigan regardless of claiming status.</li>

      <li class = "l2">Children of Morrigan are able to 'read' the destinies or fates of others. They can tell when someone has a tragic destiny or fates, as well as heroic destiny if this is written for them. This differs from prophecy because it is only aligned with individuals, not situation - moreover, nothing can be done to change the outcome.</li>
    <li>Energy Grant</li>
      <li class = "l2">Children of Morrigan have the ability to lend others energy. Unlike siphoning energy, this is a one way exchange and can only be given.

This is extremely draining and can be very dangerous for both members, and requires training to use.</li>
    <li>Strength in Numbers</li>
      <li class = "l2">Children of Morrigan can help increase the powers and energy of a large group of demigods. They cannot create powers and are only able to call upon this power in times of great need. The energy will increase the general durability and abilities of the entire group.</li>

  <h3>Lugh</h3>
  <p>
    <b>General Ability - </b>First Glory
    <br>
    Children of Lugh are natural leaders and have high intuition regarding strategic insight. They also have a high sense of morals and justice as well as a strong moral code, and are often seen as the 'righteous' person of the friend group due to this.

    <b>Pick 3:</b>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Bolt of Vengeance</li>
      <li class = "l2">Children of Lugh are able to curse people in vengeance and force them to exact vengeance on someone who has wronged either the target or the caster - once vengeance has been exacted, the curse will cease to have power over the target. This works similarly to the abilities of the children of Nemesis.</li>
    <li>True Instincts</li>

      <li class = "l2">Children of Lugh can impose their will on weaker-minded people for a maximum time of 5 minutes. This ability functions as a weaker edition of charmspeak and similarly makes the user slightly more resistant (but not immune) to charmspeak and other mind attacks.</li>

A child of Lugh is naturally resistant to electricity damage, but their power will manifest as a discharge of electricity that damages all around them if they are untrained. They are also able to concentrate these abilities in certain areas of their body, and some have mastered it enough to be able to charge a phone simply by holding the charger.</li>
    <li>Trodaire</li>
      <li class = "l2">Children of Lugh are advanced warriors with enhanced combat skills and weapon-related abilities, especially the spear. Most children of Lugh prefer a spear or a ranged weapon to a sword, but they are equally skilled with all three should the situation call for it.</li>

    <b>Pick 3:</b>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Depthsurge</li>
      <li class = "l2">Children of Danu can manipulate existing water to suit their needs. This includes shields, ropes, walls, and other uses. The greater the creation of water, the harder it is to manipulate and the more energy it takes. They are only able to manipulate water around them in a close radius; it also takes training for a child of Danu to be able to accurately control the water to their will.</li>
    <li>Heart of Water</li>
      <li class = "l2">Children of Danu are able to breathe underwater just as easily as if they were on land.

    <li>Rushing Waters</li>
      <li class = "l2">Children of Danu have the ability to heal themselves or others using water to heal wounds. Short of any imminent life-threatening injuries, they can heal most anything with enough water, time, and energy.</li>

      <li class = "l2">Children of Danu are able to control the temperature around them to a small degree. They can change the weather to become colder or warmer as they will it, but are unable to summon storms, high winds, or snow.</li>
    <li>Dark Tide</li>
      <li class = "l2">Children of Danu are able to bless or curse water, or bodies of water, at their disposal. The larger the body of water, the harder it is to bless or curse, and the more energy it takes. Curses or blessings include but are not limited to healing blessings, clearing dirty water, spoiling water, turning it undrinkable, etc.</li>
    <li>Water's Blessings</li>
      <li class = "l2">Children of Danu can draw strength from bodies of water or water in general. Once submerged in water, their abilities slightly increase and they tire less often. This also works in reverse, as a child of Danu deprived from water will see their powers weakening instead.</li>

    <li>Fierce Core</li>
      <li class = "l2">Children of Cernunnos can draw power and energy from nature. Just being in an open, grassy space, or a forest, energizes them greatly and feels like a full night of sleep to them, for example.

    <li>Feral</li>
      <li class = "l2">Children of Cernunnos have the ability to tame wild animals or vice versa via spoken words.

    <li>Glowing Aura</li>
      <li class = "l2">Children of Brigid have a brighter aura than most, regardless of claiming status. It's possible to physically manifest this power and glow like a lightbulb with enough practice, but most children of Brigid only have a spiritual aura of light, while others glow faintly in the dark instead.</li>

      <li class = "l2">Children of Aengus are able to play most instruments regardless of formal training.

    <li>Enchantress</li>

    <li>Wild Hunt</li>
      <li class = "l2">Children of Arawn are granted a hellhound familiar to aid them in battle and in their day to day life.
