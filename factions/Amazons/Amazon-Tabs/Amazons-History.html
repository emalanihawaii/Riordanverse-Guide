  <h3>The Basics</h3>
  <p>The Amazons are a tribe of female warriors, who usually worship war gods and goddesses such as Mars, Athena, or Bellona. It is not mentioned whether they are Greek or Roman, but they are assumed to be mostly Roman, as Hylla, their queen, is a Roman. (Hylla's sister Reyna, is a praetor at a Roman Demigod camp, Camp Jupiter.) They are sometimes mistaken for the Hunters of Artemis, except they are allowed to get married and have relationships with men and the Hunters cannot.</p>

  <h3>History</h3>
  <p>The Amazons existed for thousands of years as a matriarchal society founded by Otrera, daughter of Ares, god of war. The Amazons fought in joint conflicts named the Amazonomachy, against such heroes as Hercules, Theseus, and Bellerophon. During the Trojan War, they fought on as allies of the Trojan king Priam. Thousands of years later, they founded Amazon.com, to act as a front on both the mortal and the immortal world.
    <br><br>
  According to Queen Hylla, some Amazons choose to join the Hunters of Artemis, seeking eternal life, while some of Artemis' hunters choose to not stay a maiden forever, and become Amazons instead. This could explain the population of the Hunters having diminished greatly over time to the numbers they were at in The Titan's Curse.

  As revealed in Percy Jackson's Greek Gods, Ares is the Amazons' most worshiped Olympian god, since the greatest Amazon warriors were always his demigod daughters.</p>
