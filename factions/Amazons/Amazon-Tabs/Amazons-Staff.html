  <li>Amazonian Queen - Johanna</li>
    <li class = "l2">Leader of the Amazons, the queen receives a special belt from Ares himself that enhances her abilities and marks her status among the other warriors. This grants her amplified powers in times of great need. The Amazon queen also initiates new members via an entrance spar. Throne challenges are allowed upon special request with the queen OOC, but it must be approved by your faction admin as well since challenges will commence until death of either combatant.</li>
