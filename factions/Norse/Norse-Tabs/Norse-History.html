  <h3>The Basics</h3>
  <p>To enter Valhalla, one must first die. It doesn’t seem like something one would want to do, but nonetheless that is how it works. Those who die in battle, with a weapon in their hands, are picked up by the valkyries of Odin, and carried to Valhalla in Asgard. Those who make it to Valhalla are the Einherjar (Einherji for singular) and they are the chosen of Odin, waiting for the day when Ragnarok falls. All those who enter Valhalla are subjected to a telling of their story during the night of their first feast, where the valkyrie that brought them would regale the other Einherjar with the brave story of how the warrior died. In the modern day, Valhalla is set up much like a hotel, with 540 floors for as many Einherjar as can possibly fit. Each floor of Valhalla hosts an age group, usually divided into years of four, i.e. 16-20, 30-34, etc. Each Einherji is given their own room, which is automatically designed by magic to fit their personality perfectly.

  In Valhalla, you will train for the end of the world. There are many rooms about, each one for a wide assortment of activities, from war games, monster fighting, billards, soccer, art, and many many more. Most Einherjar stay in Valhalla, but some venture out into the nine worlds using the doors strewn about the Hotel on every floor. There are 540 doors leading out of Valhalla, of which lead to a different area amongst the nine worlds.</p>

  <h3>Norse Gods</h3>
  <p>The Norse Gods are a pantheon of deities central to all accounts of Norse mythology. The principal pantheon of the Norse gods is the Aesir (pronounced 'AYE-seer', traditionally spelled Æsir ), whom are connected to power and conflict, while a second pantheon comprises the Vanir (pronounced 'Vah-NEER'), whom are associated with cultivation and fertility. In Norse mythology, the two clans waged war against each other, ultimately resulting in the eventual unification of the two pantheons. Loki has stated that the Norse Gods, are two families of God, Aesir and Vanir, when he was asked by Magnus to reveal his affiliation.</p>
  
  <h4>Abilities, limitations, and weaknesses</h4>
  <p>
    The Norse gods have eternal youth granted by regular consumption of the Golden Apples of Idunn, with superhuman physical abilities and a variety of magical powers. Because the Norse gods are physical beings (like the Greco-Roman gods and unlike the Egyptian gods), they are able to sire demigod children with mortals and walk the earth without a host.
    <br><br>
    Apple-Induced Eternal Youth : The Norse gods unlike the Greek Gods or Egyptian Gods will rapidly grow old and weaken when they're unable to eat Idunn's apples of eternal youth on a regular basis. This is shown when she was kidnapped by Utgard-Loki on one occasion.<br>
    Mortality : The Norse gods are extremely difficult to kill (Mimir survived being decapitated, for instance) but they, unlike the Greco-Roman gods, are not completely immortal, as most of them are destined to die during Ragnarok, the Twilight of the Norse gods. Beings or weapons with the power to kill Norse gods include the following:<br>
    Other gods, since Loki and Heimdall are destined to kill each other.<br>
    Surt , the Lord of Muspellheim , who is destined to use Sumarbrander to kill Frey.<br>
    Fenris, the ferocious wolf, who is destined to kill Odin ; his two sons, Sköll and Hati, are also about to kill Sól the Sun and Máni the Moon after which Ragnarök would come.<br>
    Garm, the blood-stained guard dog of Hel, who is destined to kill Tyr.<br>
    Jormungand , the World Serpent, who is destined to kill Thor (though he will also be slain in the process).<br>
    Mistletoe that killed the otherwise invulnerable Baldur.<br>
    Thor's hammer Mjølnir, as he had threatened to kill Loki with it several times.
