<h2>Leadership</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Captain - Caroline</li>
      <li class = "l2">One of the many captains of the Einherjar. As Captain of the Valkyries, she is their leader, and ranks just under Odin in their hierarchy. As captain of the lower floors of Valhalla, she commands part of the army of Valhalla. She is in charge of floors 2-25, and she commands every soldier "living" on those floors. The only ones who rank higher than Captain are the Thanes, the personal guards of Odin when he goes into battle, but those are NPCs only.</li>
    <li>Valkyrie - See bottom of page</li>
      <li class = "l2">Choose slain heroes to bring to Valhalla and become einherjar.</li>
