  <h3>Odin</h3> 
  <p>
    <b>General Ability - </b>Perception Check
    <br>
    Good at looking past physical or obvious things, able to see the layers of magic on items including curses or blessings (but not identify them). Able to see when or where powers have been used (but not what powers) and can identify magic items hiding in plain sight (like the nine ducks portal to Yggdrasil). <br>
    <b>Pick 1:</b>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Seeker of Truth:</li>
      <li class = "l2">This includes advanced wisdom, knowledge, and a love for learning. In addition, users also have the ability to detect lies of any kind (omission, twisting of truth, etc) from any living being, and can also compel targets to tell the truth via spoken word. This truth does not need to be something consciously remembered, and the pressure to speak truth can only be resisted by extreme force of will. The user is also able to see through illusions, although it’s harder to see through the Mist than regular illusions…think trying to open your eyes to bright glare. </li>
    <li>Divine Wisdom:</li>
      <li class = "l2">Read the behaviors of others and deduce accordingly. With enough practice, this enables the user to become somewhat like Sherlock Holmes, being able to read between the lines and see what’s not there in order to solve problems. Those with this ability are often able to read people easily, including feelings of others, and should they choose it, they will be able to manipulate others easier than other demigods. They are also able to read any language (read only) regardless of whether or not it is spoken in the present day.</li>
    <li>Shapeshifter:</li>
      <li class = "l2">Able to shapeshift into any humanoid form, living or dead, provided they have seen an image or have an idea of what they want to shift into. This shape cannot be held indefinitely and slowly drains the energy of the wielder over time (max time, 12 hours - once time is up, you just revert back to normal form very drained). One must be in natural form to shift into another form - you can’t shift from one form to another form.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Pick 2:</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Warp:</li>
      <li class = "l2">Have the ability to create minor illusions that cannot be seen through except by other children of Odin. These illusions range from creating illusions of living things to changing the perception of reality, but they will only last for 5 minutes unless deactivated beforehand. </li>
    <li>Loyal Attendant:</li>
      <li class = "l2">Able to summon up to three animals and compel them to become the user’s assistants in any situation. Can speak to any animal via spoken language and understand them. Cannot control any animal, but can minorly influence those not in the compelled three. This works best on ravens and wolves, but other animals will do in a pinch. </li>
    <li>Polearm User: </li>
      <li class = "l2">Extremely experienced with staff or other similar spear-like weapons regardless of previous experience or learning. Hard to miss when throwing javelins or other ranged weapons that have been learned (that are not polearms). </li>
    <li>Rhythmical Composition:</li>
      <li class = "l2">Skilled in poetry, rhyming words, writing, etc (i.e. very good in rap battles). This also includes minor skill at lying - enough to fool a mechanical lie detector, but not a human one. However, most use this ability rarely as they dislike lies and falsehoods.</li>

  </ul>
</div> 
<div class = cat>
  <h3>Frigg</h3> 
  <p>
    <b>General Ability - </b>Farsight
    <br>
    Can see in 4K vision - see small details or things that may be overlooked by others. Pays attention to details and external flaws, able to see much farther than a regular demigod (such as seeing the eyes on flying birds overhead, seeing the individual hairs on a lion’s tail, etc). <br>
    <b>Pick 1:</b>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Clairvoyance:</li>
      <li class = "l2">Can see into the future or past using divination tools like cards, crystal balls, trances, etc. They are often able to accurately predict things close to the present time (up to 1 week in the future, RP time), but accuracy decreases as time goes on. Unable to predict major history-altering future events due to being blocked from interference with major events. </li>
    <li>Supreme Guidance:</li>
      <li class = "l2">Extremely persuasive naturally, but can also influence people to make a ‘right choice’ by spoken word (think like charmspeak). Almost impossible to resist, especially if the choice specified is in alignment with the ‘good’ side of the moral compass (resistance comes from strength of will). </li>
    <li>Personal Flurry:</li>
      <li class = "l2">Have the ability to create personal clouds for a short time (5-15 minutes, 15 minutes max). These clouds can do anything from providing shade, creating and providing rain and calling vicious storms (but no lightning). Can only create up to 10 medium sized 20-inch clouds at one setting. Requires an hour cooldown after the 15 minutes is up due to the strain it puts on the body.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Pick 2:</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>High-Functionality:</li>
      <li class = "l2">Usually smarter/wiser than most demigods, able to multitask easily and think quicker as well as have faster reflexes.

    <li>All-Mother:</li>
      <li class = "l2">Naturally appear friendly or welcoming to others regardless of personality. Animals and people alike are drawn to them.

    <li>Jaeger:</li>
      <li class = "l2">Unconstrained by any boundaries, possesses an extremely accurate internal compass, can track anyone provided they have a close belonging or possession of that person. Able to remove minor curses from objects or people. Partially immune to sickness or disease, but not entirely immune. </li>

      <li class = "l2">Good at textile crafts like knitting, crochet, weaving, embroidery, etc. Good at manipulating threads or ropes as a baseline.

  <h3>Thor</h3> 
  <p>
    <b>General Ability - </b>Combative
    <br>
    Easy to anger and quick to fight, but also able to use general handheld weapons although usage of an unknown weapon will always be worse than someone who has practiced with it, and it will never be mastery - just a general idea of how to use it…which is just pick it up and swing it. <br>
    <b>Pick 1:</b>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Stormbreaker: </li>
      <li class = "l2">Can summon storms, lightning, and thunder. This includes but is not limited to rain, snow, sleet, hail, etc. Conversely, they can also lessen or increase the effect of storms provided it is not hurricane level, but this is a little bit harder and more draining, and can only be used once a day. </li>
    <li>Electrokinesis: </li>
      <li class = "l2">Able to manipulate electricity and lightning, and can imbue it in their weapons to increase damage dealt, in addition to using it to speed up their reflexes and movements in battle. Resistant to electricity shocks and other lightning abilities, but not completely immune (i.e. being hit with a taser would do nothing, but getting struck by lightning feels like getting hit with a bucket of Legos). </li>
    <li>Super-Strength:</li>
      <li class = "l2">Much stronger than the average demigod, able to pick up various giant things with ease regardless of their own personal size. This is an ability that can be ‘turned on/turned off’, unlike their father’s super strength, so they can give people high-fives without breaking their entire arms, but they can also pick up full file cabinets without dropping anything. </li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Pick 2:</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Intimidation Check:</li>
      <li class = "l2">Generally very intimidating to others and radiates a minor aura of fear. Good at being persuasive, can bluff people somewhat easily, decent at diplomacy, just overall very charismatic. </li>
    <li>Goat-Kinesis:</li>
      <li class = "l2">Able to speak to, summon, and charm any and all goats. Can communicate via spoken language and are usually recognized by goats as children of the deity regardless of claiming status. With extreme concentration, they can see through the eyes of a nearby goat and essentially 'possess' it for 5 minutes (maximum time). </li>
    <li>Hammer Time:</li>
      <li class = "l2">Skilled with hammers and axes regardless of experience. Hard to miss if using throwing axes or just flat out throwing their hammer/axe (but this only applies to hammers and axes…they’ll definitely miss throwing a dagger unless they’re otherwise trained). Can summon said hammer or axe (one at a time, no double-summon) provided it is in a nearby 5-foot radius. Also, for some reason, they’re good at dancing.</li>
    <li>Dolby Stereo: </li>
      <li class = "l2">Extremely loud. Able to shout and yell long distances and even short-term deafen someone by screaming at them. Easily heard when speaking, can yell loud enough to shatter glass for brief periods. </li>
    <li>Potting Soil:</li>
      <li class = "l2">Plants grow quicker in their presence. They cannot intentionally change un-fertile soil into fertile soil, but existing plants will grow quicker and plants planted by them will yield more fruit or flowers than others of its type.</li>
  </ul>
</div> 
<div class = cat>
  <h3>Sif</h3> 
  <p>
    <b>General Ability - </b>Giantess
    <br>
    Stronger than most average demigods, able to pick up various giant things with ease regardless of their own personal size. This is an ability that cannot be ‘turned on/turned off’, so children of this deity must be very careful with their strength so as not to injure others. Most children of this deity learn it early and subconsciously do so after some time.<br>
    <b>Pick 1:</b>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Geokinesis:</li>
      <li class = "l2">Able to manipulate the ground around them by touch or gesture. Can use the earth as an extension of themselves with seismic sense and feel things around them. However, they cannot manipulate steel or metal - it must be untainted earth. Can create walls, shields, weapons, etc, out of the ground, but the bigger it is, the harder it is to make. Shields would be easier to make versus a storm of asteroids, for example. </li>
    <li>Blood of the Earth: </li>
      <li class = "l2">Control, manipulate, and create lava and/or heat. Able to raise temperatures and endure higher heat levels than other demigods. Will not burn when touching heated objects, and is able to control existing lava in addition to creating it. Too much lava, however, will often force the user into overheating (think a high grade fever). </li>
    <li>Hair-Kinesis:</li>
      <li class = "l2">Can cut off their hair and weave it into a tangible, solid object, with the exception of money or monetary change. In addition, their hair requires special scissors to cut, which can only be used by a child of the deity. Their hair grows faster than most demigods (usually about six inches a day, with a total cap length of down to said child’s ankles) and often requires unconventional manners to deal with it, but each strand of hair is like fine wire that is hard to break. Those with this power also have skill in crafts and arts pertaining to yarn.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Pick 2:</b></p>
    <ul>
    <li>Miracle-Gro:</li>
      <li class = "l2">Have the ability to control plants and speed up their growth, or make them grow in previously unfertile soil. Existing plants grow faster in their presence, and plants planted by them will grow faster and yield more product than others of its type. </li>
    <li>Restoration: </li>
      <li class = "l2">In addition to general knowledge of healing herbs, plants, and potion combinations, children of this deity are able to heal others with special mud and plants they create.

    <li>Harvester:</li>
      <li class = "l2">Drain energy from one person, animal, or plant at a time (not fatal, it’s really slow and augments you only). Users are also skilled at using a scythe or sickle in combat. This also works in reverse, where one can augment someone else’s energy over a slow rate by taking it from animals, plants, or others (not yourself).</li>
    <li>Guardian:</li>
      <li class = "l2">Skilled in combat and martial arts. Generally proficient with a sword-shield combo, but all other weapons are just as good. While they are not able to immediately master weapons without some training, they can use any weapon rudimentarily for about 15-20 minutes.</li>
    <li>Family Ties:</li>
      <li class = "l2">Able to see the godly parentage of any demigod regardless of claiming status and prior knowledge of the god. If it’s a god that is unknown or wishes to be undiscovered, the parent will appear as a shadowy, invisible figure to the child of the deity. </li>

  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Hydrokinesis:</li>
      <li class = "l2">Can manipulate, control, and summon water. Most times, the water summoned will be salt water, and they control salt water best, but this also works with other forms of water. However, this ability does not extend to liquids - only water.</li>
    <li>Stormterror:</li>

Each new form counts as one shift. </li>
    <li>Pyrokinesis:</li>
      <li class = "l2">Mastery over and manipulation of existing fire, as well as the creation of flame from your own body’s energy (you can’t burn down a forest - the flame involved would kill you). Can also control heat.</li>

      <li class = "l2">Can change anything into a weapon in a pinch, but they can’t do it often. The weapons they create are ‘Made’ into something more dangerous than what they are before, and they never break or wear down. Users can only ‘Make’ a weapon once every few days due to the drain it takes on their magic.</li>

  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Unbreakable Vow:</li>
      <li class = "l2">Able to create binding contracts between two or more parties, like a weaker version of the Styx Swear. These contracts are near impossible to break, unless intentionally done, and the breaking of this contract will result in severe retribution for all parties involved, including the caster. Casters have the ability to annul this vow at any time with consent of all parties involved.</li>
    <li>Retribution: </li>
      <li class = "l2">Have the ability to reflect any power or attack back on enemies - the larger the power/attack, the harder it is to reflect. If it's too big to reflect back safely, the power/attack will then be turned aside and rendered useless for a short time. Consecutive uses of this power become exponentially more draining.</li>
    <li>Divine Order:</li>
      <li class = "l2">Restore tangibly 'broken' or damaged objects to their original state. This applies to physical wounds, shattered glass, dented shields, etc. You must be able to touch at least the surface in order to fix it, but once touched, all damaged sections will be repaired. </li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Pick 2:</b></p>
    <ul>
    <li>Telumkinesis:</li>
      <li class = "l2">Skilled with weapons. Able to pick up any weapon in a pinch and use it well (not mastery) regardless of any prior training or lack thereof. Can place marks on weapons by touch to summon them at times of need. These marks are invisible to the naked eye but wear off after a few hours.</li>
    <li>Sharpshot:</li>
      <li class = "l2">Proficiency with ranged weapons. Their shots will always fly true to their target provided they can clearly see their target, unless this ability is physically blocked (i.e. projectile blocked by an arrow/weapon interference).</li>
    <li>Sacrificial:</li>
      <li class = "l2">See the risks and benefits of certain immediate choices (must happen in the same day/near future/next 24 hours) made by others. The more momentous the choice or decision, the harder it is to see clearly and discern the paths. Unable to interfere with the choice regardless of consequences, however - justice must be blind.</li>
    <li>Speaker of Truth:</li>
      <li class = "l2">Can be a human lie detector - unable to directly lie themselves, but can conceal truth by omission. They can also tell when someone else is omitting the truth or lying, but cannot compel them to speak true.</li>

    <b>Pick 1:</b>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Golden Apple: </li>
      <li class = "l2">Enchant healing apples from regular apples by touch (think Minecraft ability, you touch it, it becomes magic and heals whoever eats it).

    <li>Hebekinesis:</li>
      <li class = "l2">Have the ability to manipulate the ages of themselves and others as well as control the consciousness of the person in their form (i.e. if you turn into a 4 year old, you can either shift your brain back to where it was when you were four, or keep your whatever age memories). Only one person can be age-changed at a time.</li>
    <li>Spring Forward:</li>
      <li class = "l2">Able to manipulate time on a person, object, or event, up to 1 hour forward or 1 hour backwards. This lasts only for the hour before time resets back to its original time, or is dispelled by the user. Events may or may not play out the same way they did in the previous hour, and there will not be doubles of anyone - they will just be shoved backwards or forwards in time. </li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Pick 2:</b></p>
    <ul>
    <li>New Beginnings: </li>
      <li class = "l2">Can ward off sickness, old age, and even death (if the person is not yet dead), while encouraging life, health, and personal growth just by their very presence.

      <li class = "l2">Cause plants to grow faster. Summon existing flowers and other vegetation out of the ground if they are there (i.e. you can't summon anything if the ground is frozen). Minor control of plants. </li>
    <li>Stare:</li>
