    Relia was left at the wolf house when she was nine years old.  She completed her trial in about a week and was sent in search of New Rome.
  </p>
  <p><b>Extra Backstory:</b></p>
  <p id = "i">
    After she was born her biological father put her up for adoption due to him not wanting a kid.  After this she was placed in foster care by the California government.  Year after year she was placed into a different home.  Every time she was moved was due to a different monster attack.  It was on the last home she was sent to that there were so many monster attacks that the mortals thought she was insane and was institutionalized for about 3 months.  It was then that her most recent family found her.  It was a couple of demigods who had left the legion and New Rome.  They trained her well and dropped her off at the wolf house when they thought she was ready.  After her “parents” left they were attacked by a hydra and killed.  When Relia was just nine years old she was left at the wolf house.  It took her about a week to pass the trials of Lupa and make her way to New Rome.  When she arrived she was inducted into the legion.  While in the legion Relia went to a small school in New Rome.  After 7 years of service she was promoted to centurion of the fifth cohort.  Another three years of service and the praetor before her stepped down and she was elected into their spot.

  <p><b>Journey to the Nexus:</b></p>
  <p id = "i">Born in Monterey, California, Calum wasn't always the fierce warrior she is now. For the first nine years of her life, her name was Elizabeth Joy Maryan, and she was the youngest daughter of a family of five - her father, the mechanic, her step-mother, the businesswoman and part time housewife, and her two older twin brothers, the dickheads who were both teenagers for as long as she knew them. </p>
  <p id = "i">At the age of nine, she ran away from the family while they were on a business trip in Berkeley, tired of the constant ridicule and abuse warring with the call inside of her that there was something better out there. The wolves at the Wolf House took her in, scenting her demigod blood, and she became one of them for about half a year, training for a place the wolves only ever whispered about: the Nexus of the Gods and the Ninth Legion of Rome. She never stood out and never showed her powers if she even had any, but the others at the Wolf House learned quickly that her words could cut just as easily as her blade.</p>
  <p id = "i">After her release by Lupa just before her tenth birthday, Calum made the journey across the country to the Nexus in Ohio and was placed on probation with only her letter from Lupa to speak for her - which was well deserved. At least, that was the public opinion of her - until they saw her fight in training and in war games. Her claiming mark appeared a good year later, and most bets were on Mars or Minerva because she preferred to speak with her actions instead of words back then.</p>
  <p id = "i">Once claimed, most of her powers except for the energy transferral had already kicked in, and the decision was made to move her from the Fifth Cohort to the Second, where she stayed until her praetorship.</p>
  <p><b>Extra Backstory:</b></p>
  <p id = "i">Melee fighter, marksman, and mercenary for hire, Calum Saskia is the current Roman Praetor of the Ninth Legion alongside her colleague Natalia Stewart.</p>
  <p id = "i">Appointed as Praetor at 17, Calum has been in Rome for a total of 9 years, with three of those years as centurion, and one of them as Praetor following the death of a former praetor in Arracyon's attack on Rome. Her reputation is mostly non-existent and consists of material after achieving praetorship, as most legionnaires only knew them as a quiet centurion who drew dragons on paperwork and fileted fish with the same finesse they used in battle. Now, most legionnaires are familiar with the praetor who uses poison darts and a spear and enjoys blasting metal music after late-night meetings, and although he has no shortage of secrets, he has no shortage of friends and family either.</p>
  <p id = "i">During one of her first battles as a Praetor - the final battle with Arracyon, she led the Roman forces against the rogue demigods and was eventually one of the lucky (or rather, unlucky) fighters that engaged Arracyon. Around this time, a second war involving Rome and her co-praetor's ex-girlfriend was taking place, and they participated in this other war as well (before his official instatement as praetor, Calum worked as an undercover informant who gathered information in order to aid the Legion). This war was one of the more bloody ones, giving Calum one of her darker fears - that one day, he wouldn't be fast enough or strong enough to protect the people he loved. Even with around eight years of training, their defenses were no match for a single person - Alyssa, the vengeful woman who swore to destroy Rome at any and all costs. Only with her co-praetor and a few others was she able to overwhelm Alyssa and restore peace to Rome.</p>
  <p id = "i">In the chaos of the wars, he was forced to face past issues and come to terms with the matter of having affection for others (previously, the praetor saw attachments as a danger, and refused to let himself get attached to others when it would compromise their safety) and eventually ended up dating a centurion, although their relationship was kept under wraps for security purposes. His partner eventually ended up completing a spy mission during the war (not his first, and definitely not his last), and Calum pushed herself fully into finding a way to end Rome's second conflict. Ultimately, this second war ended with a dragon attack that claimed the life of their co-praetor, who sacrificed himself to protect the camp and city, and Calum chose Centurion Natalia of the second cohort to take his spot. The loss of her co-praetor weighs on her heavily some days, even though it might not be obvious at all times.</p>
  <p id = "i">Calum also headed the aerial division of the Ninth Legion during the second war as opposed to melee fighting, but dissolved it later on in order to free up the eagles for recon and surveillance instead. Despite almost never using it, he's highly trained in aerial combat, although he is much more skilled fighting on the ground and highly adapted to melee fighting for training and practical purposes. On good days, they even fly out with the recon wing to do their patrols from the air instead of the ground, but ultimately Calum does most of their battles on solid standing as opposed to the air. She also has a falcon friend that helps in short-term surveillance - Essix, the perpetually hungry peregrine falcon that can usually be found stealing food or masquerading as a hat (the joke between legionnaires is that Essix will trust anyone who gives him birdseed, but those trying to escape prank punishment or mandatory meetings will find it pretty quickly that it's really just a joke, and a badly timed one at that). Despite his appearance, the falcon is rather intelligent and smarter than most give him credit for - hence why Calum uses him as an auxiliary scout when necessary, and for recon on a daily basis to check up on the other residents of the Nexus.</p>
  <p id = "i">Credited with the demise of Niobe in one of his more recent quests, Calum has himself established as a fierce fighter and defender of his friends and family - that is, the Nexus. She's willing to do anything to ensure the safety of the Nexus as a whole, and isn't above seeking outside help should it be necessary. While Calum isn't a naturally vengeful person, when their justice is evoked, it will not be recalled. Most times, you can find them with their trusty frying pan at their side (a birthday gift from an ex-legionnaire, imperial gold with a bone steel core and a shiv in the handle) and a cup of coffee in hand. He specializes in anything weapon combat related, but is just as capable of kicking ass with or without weapons.</p>
  <p id = "i">After her quest that ended with her leading the Amazons back to the Nexus, Calum put aside some of her Roman responsibilities to focus on the Amazons for a time to help their queen get acclimated with the Nexus. During this time, she and Queen Johanna became good friends, and Calum did eventually join the Amazons as a reserve fighter as a result of this. He's more than a little different than what he used to be before the quest, with black armor instead of gold some days, but inside she still values the protection of others and will do anything to ensure that. They have both sewn and burned too many shrouds to not care, and there are too many memories they carry alone these days. Too much infighting and war has ultimately convinced them that peaceful ways might have a future as opposed to just straight up steel and blood, but she’s not above swinging a sword and knocking heads should it be necessary - which it usually is.</p>
  <p id = "i">In terms of relationships, Calum doesn't care about them, but if she has the fortune (or misfortune) to have one, the person/people whom she dates will be first priority under her work as a leader. Those who hurt them have very serious consequences following, whether or not they are currently dating. Those who manage to count Calum as a friend also fall under such protection. Her list of people includes Arcadia, the Lieutenant of the Hunt, Alexa, the Oracle of the Nexus, Natalia, another Centurion of the second cohort whom Calum dated for a short time before she was praetor, and a scant few others who have managed to gain her trust, although whether they can keep it remains to be seen.</p>
  <p id = "i">If you’re lucky, you might catch a glimpse of her purple cape around the Nexus. Be careful, and don’t make any sudden moves if you want to try your chances. Like any other child of war, they'll take no prisoners and shows no mercy.</p>
