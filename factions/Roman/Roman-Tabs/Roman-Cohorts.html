<h2>Cohorts</h2>
<div class = "cat">
  <h3>General Information</h3>
  <p>The cohorts are typically groups of forty legionnaires who serve the Legion. Each cohort is headed by 2 centurions who control the 4 barracks with ten bunks in each used by their cohort. The Twelfth Legion Fulminata(Camp Jupiter in California) has five cohorts, however Ninth Legion Ignerata only has 4, leaving out the first cohort out of respect for the original Camp Jupiter. The cohorts are ranked from best (2) to worst (5) imitating the ancient Roman cohort structure. Campers may bring letters of recommendations to camp to get into a good cohort - the better the letter, the better the chance of them making it into the better cohorts.</p>

  <h3>Cohort Information</h3>
  <h4>Second Cohort</h4>
  <p>Highest of the cohorts and most renowned for its prestige, the Second Cohort is comprised of senior legionnaires or those with exceptional recommendations either from Lupa or from retired legionnaires that speak for them.</p>
  <h4>Third Cohort</h4>
  <p>Regarded as the baseline cohort, for legionnaires, as the 'mediocre' fighter category in some cases, although its legionnaires tend to be the more versatile types. Most times, people are transferred to this cohort and not placed there by recommendation letter.</p>
  <h4>Fourth Cohort</h4>
  <p>The infamous troublemaking cohort of camp, the Fourth is composed of people who are working their way up from the Fifth, or those deemed particularly mischievous.</p>
  <h4>Fifth Cohort</h4>
  <p>Every legionnaire without a sufficient enough recommendation to warrant a transfer to a higher cohort is placed in the Fifth. Probatio legionnaires stay here as well until assigned to a cohort.</p>
