<h2>The Romans Basic Info and History</h2>
<div class = "cat">
  <h3>Basic Information</h3>
  <p>Camp Jupiter initially involved only the Twelfth Legion Fulminata stationed in Berkeley, California, but upon the creation of the Nexus, the Ninth Legion Ignerata was reunited and stationed in Ohio with the Nexus by Jupiter himself. Associated with fire, the Ninth Legion's patron is Vulcan, the ninth olympian; the aquila of this legion has the ability to strike enemies with flames and decimate their ranks with an inferno's wrath. Said aquila is stored in the principia, where it is cared for by the various cohorts as a symbol of the Legion's legitimacy to the gods and other pantheons. </p>
  <br>
  <p>Newcomers to Camp Jupiter are assigned a cohort based on a dice roll; should a newcomer not wish to roll for a cohort, they will stay in the Fifth Cohort's barracks until their own cohort is chosen, regardless of claiming status, which can be granted one of two ways : by committing an act of valor that draws the attention of a godly parent, or by completing a full year in the Legion. Once claimed, legionnaires receive a mark signifying their godly parent, and one line underneath it for every completed year in the Legion. </p>
  <br>
  <p>Unlike the Twelfth Legion, the Ninth Legion has no first cohort for reasons unknown to its current leaders. The camp itself is to the south side of the Nexus Center, with its campgrounds being an almost exact replica of the Twelfth Legion's own setup (the only difference being that there are no first cohort barracks, and there are no barricades or hard borders of camp that separate it from the others). </p>
  <br>
  <p>Once instated to a cohort, newcomers answer to their centurion(s) and praetors. Should a problem arise with fellow legionnaires and/or centurions, legionnaires are expected to report to either their centurion or praetor, who will handle the situation accordingly in times of need. Centurions and praetors are also available for aid in other situations if needed (this includes but is not limited to pranks, spars, training, etc). </p>

  <h3>Pantheon Information</h3>
  <p>The Roman gods are the more bellicose and stern gods of the Hellenic Pantheon, as opposed to the more laid-back Greek deities. They care less for their children than the Greeks and focus their attention more on the Legion as a whole; even with the Develra incident, the Roman gods are distinctively reserved in that they prefer to speak indirectly to their children and guide them anonymously, if at all. Sometimes, the Roman gods will walk the earth in their vessels, or appear to mortals and demigods as it suits them, but they do so irregularly. The Roman gods prefer a more objective point of view, in keeping with the Roman traditions regarding honor and virtue as well as strength.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Most Roman gods also have a Greek form, which may or may not affect their personality. Nine times out of ten, the Roman personality will be much stricter and rule-oriented than the Greek personality; however, there are also gods who do not have Greek forms, such as Janus Quirinius, Terminus, Bellona, Orcus, and Pomona, to name a few. Most gods without a Greek form tend to be minor gods, with a few exceptions. </p>
