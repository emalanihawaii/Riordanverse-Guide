<h2>Cabins</h2>
<div class = "cat">
  <h3>General Information</h3>
  <p>The Cabins, also known as the Divine Cabins, at Camp Halfblood each represent one of the Greek Dieties. Demigods attending the camp stay in the respective cabins patronized by their immortal parents. Initially, only twelve cabins were built for the children of the Olympians. Those of other minor gods or unclaimed children of the twelve would reside with the children of Hermes in Cabin Eleven(11). After the second Titan War, Percy Jackson requested that Hades and the minor gods be given their own cabins as well. At the original Camp Halfblood in New York there are now 20 cabins.</p>

  <h3>Cabin Information</h3>
  
  <h3>Zeus Cabin</h3>
  <h5>Cabin 1</h5>
  <p id = "i"><b>Exterior:</b> A marble building looking like a mausoleum with heavy columns. The big bronze doors are polished in such a way to provide a 'holographic' effect of lightning bolts passing across. It also thunders all the time. It has also been described as looking like a bank.</p>
  <p id = "i"><b>Interior:</b> The inside has a dome-shaped ceiling that is decorated with moving mosaics of a cloudy sky and thunderbolts. This cabin is different from the original with the Zeus statue being removed and bunks placed around the room along with other furniture to make the cabin feel more like a home.</p>
  
  <h3>Hera Cabin</h3>
  <h5>Cabin 2</h5>
  <p id = "i"><b>Exterior:</b> Another marble, formal-looking building, graceful with slim columns garlanded with pomegranates and flowers. The walls and doors also have images of peacocks cared on them.</p>
  <p id = "i"><b>Interior:</b> Since this cabin is not meant to be functional but rather honorary, more like a temple, there is no furniture inside other than the large statue of Hera and the firepit at its feet.</p>
  
  <h3>Poseidon Cabin</h3>
  <h5>Cabin 3</h5>
  <p id = "i"><b>Exterior:</b> A long, low building with windows facing the ocean. The cabin is made from rough sea stone, pieces of coral and seashell embedded into the outside walls, and a trident with a big bronze number 3 over the door. The cabin smalls like the beach and there is always a good sea breeze blowing through it.</p>
  <p id = "i"><b>Interior:</b> The walls are made of abalone and there are neat bunks with silk sheets and a saltwater fountain that is made out of grey sea rock with a fish that spouts water from its mouth and coral decoration, a recreation of the fountain the percy sliced in half at the original camp halfblood. This fountain is useful for making Iris messages and even has Golden drachmas around it for this exact reason.</p>

  <h3>Demeter Cabin</h3>
  <h5>Cabin 4</h5>
  <p id = "i"><b>Exterior:</b> The cabin is a light shade of brown however it is covered in flowers and tomato plants grow on the walls and doorway. Wildflowers and roses grow on the porch. It also has a real grass roof.</p>
  <p id = "i"><b>Interior:</b> The floor is grass and there is an oak tree in the center to hold up the ceiling.</p>

  <h3>Ares Cabin</h3>
  <h5>Cabin 5</h5>
  <p id = "i"><b>Exterior:</b> The cabin is badly painted red with a large boar's head over the door and barbed wire on the roof. The cabin is lined with land mines so be careful where you step. </p>

  <h3>Athena Cabin</h3>
  <h5>Cabin 6</h5>
  <p id = "i"><b>Exterior:</b> A grey building with plain white curtains and a design of an owl over the door.</p>
  <p id = "i"><b>Interior:</b> The cabin has a workshop inside along with a library. The library is filled with thousands of books and old scolls, as well as tables and chairs for demigods to study and read. The workshop is crammed with tables and workbenches, and the cupboards are filled with materials to build things. There are also several 3D models of buildings, blueprints, old war maps, and armor. The cabin is also filled with SMART boards and other things typically found in classrooms. The bunks are all shoved together against one  wall so that there is more space to work.</p>

  <h3>Apollo Cabin</h3>
  <h5>Cabin 7</h5>
  <p id = "i"><b>Exterior:</b> The cabin is made of solid gold and glows in the daytime. It's hard to tell if the gold is reflecting light or generating it. </p>
  <p id = "i"><b>Interior:</b> The cabin has bunk beds on either side with a cot in the middle of the cabin for the injured. Rough cedar beams that rib the ceiling and the white plaster walls are bare except for a few hooks for coats and weapons. It smells of clean linen and dried sage. The only decorations are some flowerpots on the windowsill, filled with cheerful yellow blooms from the island of Delos and one flowerpot with red and purple hyacinths. These flowers only grow in and around the cabin. There is a bookshelf with reference material about Apollo for new campers to read.</p>

  <h3>Artemis Cabin</h3>
  <h5>Cabin 8</h5>
  <p id = "i"><b>Exterior:</b> The cabin is all silver with silver curtains, similar to the outfit of the Hunters. It also glows silver during the night as if reflecting the moon but it looks like a normal cabin during the day. It is decorated with paintings and carvings of wild animals, but mostly the stag. Since Artemis does not have children of her own, the cabin is honorary however it is used by the Hunters when they are in camp.</p>
  <p id = "i"><b>Interior:</b></p>

  <h3>Hephaestus Cabin</h3>
  <h5>Cabin 9</h5>
  <p id = "i"><b>Exterior:</b> The cabin looks like a small factory, with brick walls and smokestacks like the forges and lots of gears around the entrance.</p>
  <p id = "i"><b>Interior:</b> The cabin has folded steel bunks against the walls. Each bed has a digital control panel, blinking LED lights, glowing gems, and interlocking gears. It has shiny metal walls and metal slated doors. It is often unclean and messy, filled with junk most of the time. A fire pole comes down from the second floor, although from the outside, the extra floor is not visible. A circular staircase leads down into some kind of basement. The walls are lined with every kind of power tool imaginable and a huge assortment of weaponry. A workbench overflows with scrap metals, screws, bolts, washers, nails, rivets, and a million other machine parts.</p>

  <h3>Aphrodite Cabin</h3>
  <h5>Cabin 10</h5>
  <p id = "i"><b>Exterior:</b> The cabin is made of wood with a painted blue roof, pillars, checkerboard deck with steps, and grey walls. It also smells heavily of designer perfume.</p>
  <p id = "i"><b>Interior:</b> The cabin has pink walls with white window trim. There are also lace curtains that are pastel blue and green which match the sheets and feather comforters on all the beds. The guys have one row of bunks separated by a curtain, but their section of the cabin is just as neat and orderly as the girls'. The cabin is always clean except for under the beds, which have chocolate wrappers, love notes, and other things under them. Every camper has a wooden camp chest at the foot of their bunk with their name painted on it. The only other bit of individualism was how the campers had decorated their private bunk spaces. Each has slightly different pictures tacked up of whatever celebrities they thought were hot. A few have personal photos, too, but most were actors or singers.</p>

  <h3>Hermes Cabin</h3>
  <h5>Cabin 11</h5>
  <p id = "i"><b>Exterior:</b> The cabin has peeling brown paint and a caduceus over the door. It is probably in such bad shape because it was over-populated.</p>
  <p id = "i"><b>Interior:</b> The cabin is packed at all times. It has at least one bedroom with two twin beds, a wooden nightstand in between the two beds with a Grecian urn on it, a trunk at the end of the bed, Winged Shoes hung on a hook, a wooden desk and a chair, and curtains on the windows for privacy. Posters, pictures, a sword, a map of Camp Half-Blood and a calendar hangs on the wall. Once more demigods started getting claimed and the minor gods' cabins were built, space conditions improved.</p>

  <h3>Hades Cabin</h3>

  <p id = "i"><b>Interior:</b> The interior has beds that resemble coffins, with mahogany frames, brass railings, and bloodred velvet blankets and pillows. According to Nico, "Apparently somebody thought that the children of Hades were vampires, not demigods." Hazel had partitioned off her side of the cabin with sheets so that "it looked like a quarantine zone," although they were most likely taken down by now.</p>
