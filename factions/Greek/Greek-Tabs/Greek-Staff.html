  <p><b>Backstory:</b></p>
    <p id = "i">
      Alexa has been able to see through the Mist as long as she could remember. Her mother and father were both mortal, and knew nothing of the godly world. That changed when Alexa’s baby brother was born when she was only eight years old. It was clear that the two of them did not share a father, and Alexa saw the father of her brother. Being able to see through the Mist, she could clearly see that it was actually the god Bacchus that was the father, the Roman god of wine. Ever since that day, monsters would show up. Most mortals couldn’t see them, but of course she could. She would run and hide from the monsters, and this continued until one day she met an older man. He was in his sixties, and despite his age he killed the monsters as if they were nothing more than minor inconveniences. Alexa befriended the old man, and that was when her world opened up. The man’s name was Percy Jackson, and he told Alexa about everything she saw. He told her about a camp in Ohio where Alexa and her brother could be safe from monsters. After a couple phone calls and another monster attack, Percy gave Alexa directions to the camp, and it was to there she made her way for a new life.

  <p><b>Journey to the Nexus:</b></p>
  <p id = "i">
    	 While it is uncommon, Artemis is sometimes accompanied by twenty of her hunters on visits to Olympus. On one particular occasion, this group included Deyanira, Anastasia, and Lieutenant Nightshade. It was just a normal Summer Solstice meeting, no one could have predicted what would come of this trip. Olympus is a strange place and the effects it has on everyone differs, for Deyanira it unlocked her Godly form for the first time. It was not an immediate transformation, when the hunters made it to the throne room, they stood in their usual spot to the sides of Artemis's throne.   
  </p>
  <br>
  <p id = "i">
    The meeting started and all was fine, or it seemed like it was. To be honest most of the hunters weren't really listening, they just had to be there. Throughout the entire meeting, Deyanira could tell something was off. She wasn't sure if anyone else felt the strange aura in the air, but if they could their faces didn't show it. She seemed more fidgety than usual, shifting her weight from one side to the other and pulling on the collar of her shirt as though it was choking her. 
  </p>
  <br>
  <p id = "i">
    As the meeting was wrapping up, a flash of light came from next to Artemis's throne. From the flash emerged the goddess Deyanira in her true form for the first time. She stood taller than the Olympians, a spitting image of her mother with a few differences to show her time in the hunt. The Olympians were faearful of this threat and while the goddess was processing what had happened, they chained her up with unbreakable chains to keep her from hurting them. 
  </p>
  <br>
  <p id = "i">
    Artemis rose from her seat to diffuse the situation, stating that goddesses are often part of the hunt and that this was not some huge scandal with Nyx trying to overthrow Olympus. Her story was backed up by the fact that Deyanira stayed still in her chains, not fighting against them or trying to get out of them in any way, she seemed to have just accepted her fate. With the goddess staying still and the distinct differences that were more apparent when the Olympians had calmed down, they were able to determine that she was, in fact, not Nyx.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p id = "i">
    With the commotion stopped, the gods could decide what to do with Deyanira. Since Dionysus had already finished his sentence and they could not find a suitable replacement for him, it was decided that Deyanira would stay at the Nexus as Camp Half Blood's new camp director. She was stripped of her goddess immortality and sent away to the Nexus. 
  </p>
  <p><b>Extra Backstory:</b></p>
  <p id = "i">
    She was born in the Mansion of Night and has spent most of her life in Tartarus. In the first few years of her life she developed her powers and learned to fight. After a while it got boring, there’s only so many times you can explore Tartarus by flying around before it gets mundane. That, and there's only so many times you can tell a spirit of fear to shove off before it stops taking you seriously. Bored by the shadows and perpetual darkness, and tired of killing monsters just to get around safely, Deyanira started researching ways to get out of this place - she had heard that there were ways for deities to manifest outside of their physical realm, although those techniques were rumored to be taught from mother to daughter, from father to son - not learned. 
  </p>
  <br>
  <p id = "i">
    Unwilling to tell her parents where she was going, she would instead sneak away to visit the humans via the Labyrinth, an untraceable way to escape and travel through realms, even by the gods. Visiting the humans was intriguing, but after a while, Deyanira became bored with simply visiting and began to take part in human life at the time, although it became harder for her to stay hidden because of her frequent appearances in the long passage of time - some regarded her as a time traveler, which wasn't exactly wrong, but they began to suspect her as more than human although none saw her leave or disappear and move through worlds. 
  </p>
  <br>
  <p id = "i">
    During her first visit through the Labyrinth, she exited the Labyrinth in the middle of the Hunter’s campsite. Of course seeing an intruder appear from nowhere got the Hunter’s attention and came at her with their knives at first. She did her best to not injure the hunters as she made space so she could get off the ground. Once she had enough space, she took off into the sky, her wounds dripping ichor onto the ground where she had stood. As she flew away, the Hunter’s Lieutenant, Arcadia, had just enough time to fire an arrow at Deyanira, which embedded itself just at the base of her left wing. This injury was enough to knock her out of the sky. Arcadia, seeing the Ichor on the ground, got help from Artemis to track down the fallen goddess in the forest. 
  </p>
  <br>
  <p id = "i">
    Leaving the rest of the Hunter’s at camp, Arcadia and Artemis ventured into the forest in the general direction Deyanira had flown in. When they found her, they pointed their weapons at her, demanding to know who she was and what her intentions were. Deyanira brought a solid wall of shadow up between her and them, hoping to prevent further injury, but when she realized she could not get the arrow out herself and that she was too weak to shadow away, she had to figure out some way out of this. Knowing that there would be consequences for her if the other Olympians knew about her, she begged Artemis to not tell anyone that she had seen her. After Artemis swore on the Styx that she wouldn’t tell, she let the wall fall. 
  </p>
  <br>
  <p id = "i">
    Looking defeated, the young goddess stated that she had no intentions of harming anyone. She refused to tell them who her parents were and why she was a goddess but she did reveal her name. She went with the Lieutenant and Lady Artemis back to the Hunter’s camp where they fixed her injuries, and helped her regain her strength. At full strength once again, Deyanira stayed with the hunters for a bit, accompanying them on hunts before having to return back to Tartarus so as to not alert her parents to her disappearance.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p id = "i">
    During her next few visits, Deyanira would always set off to find the Hunters if she was able to. Becoming close friends with Arcadia, eventually revealing the godly parents only to her. Her visits slowly became longer with less time spent in the underworld between. Eventually she took the oath and pledged herself to the service of Artemis and never turned back.
