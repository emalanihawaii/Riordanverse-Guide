  <p><b>Backstory:</b></p>
    <p id = "i">
      Alexa has been able to see through the Mist as long as she could remember. Her mother and father were both mortal, and knew nothing of the godly world. That changed when Alexa’s baby brother was born when she was only eight years old. It was clear that the two of them did not share a father, and Alexa saw the father of her brother. Being able to see through the Mist, she could clearly see that it was actually the god Bacchus that was the father, the Roman god of wine. Ever since that day, monsters would show up. Most mortals couldn’t see them, but of course she could. She would run and hide from the monsters, and this continued until one day she met an older man. He was in his sixties, and despite his age he killed the monsters as if they were nothing more than minor inconveniences. Alexa befriended the old man, and that was when her world opened up. The man’s name was Percy Jackson, and he told Alexa about everything she saw. He told her about a camp in Ohio where Alexa and her brother could be safe from monsters. After a couple phone calls and another monster attack, Percy gave Alexa directions to the camp, and it was to there she made her way for a new life.

    <b>Name:</b> Deyanira <br>
    <b>Age:</b> Looks 21; Cronologically 3000+ but no one knows that other than Arc <br>
    <b>Godly Association:</b> Daughter of Nyx and Erebus <br>

    <b>Abilities/Powers:</b> <br>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>General Ability: Mother of the Night(Nyx)</li>
      <li class = "l2">Wherever they go, the world always appears cloudy or dim to them. This also has a permanent effect on their powers of darkness, enhancing them.</li>
    <li>General Ability: Dark Soul (Erebus)</li>
      <li class = "l2">Able to carve the symbol of their father into a living or dead body, and “sell” its soul to Erebus, trapping them in the realm of Darkness forever. Erebus will then feed on their soul. This symbol can be engraved even onto immortals. Primordials and their demigod children are immune to it.</li>
    <li>Lady of Fear (Erebus)</li>
      <li class = "l2">Radiates an aura of fear so intense that it can frighten weaker demigods into fainting, stronger ones into stillness, and even terrify monsters or gods into running away.</li>
    <li>Starbearer (Nyx)</li>
      <li class = "l2">Can manipulate stars and celestial bodies at will. Upon birth they are given a shard of a celestial star from their mother which they can control. The shard by itself is denser than anything found on earth, and can burn with the heat of a blue star.</li>
    <li>Umbral Lord (Erebus and Nyx)</li>

    <li>Nyx’s Wake (Erebus and Nyx)</li>
      <li class = "l2">Blot out the Sun for brief periods of time. This power can also sometimes activate on accident if they lose control. While blotted out, any powers of light are diminished severely, and children and followers of Sun gods (any pantheon) feel weaker.</li>
    <li>Spectral Creation (Nyx)</li>
      <li class = "l2">Create objects out of shadows. These objects are tangible and can affect others, however they will dissipate if they get too far from their creator or are cast in a bright light.</li>

  </ul>
  <p><b>Journey to the Nexus:</b></p>
  <p id = "i">
    	On a routine visit to the Nexus, she went to check the children of underworld deities, she would do this every time she was in the overworld however this time took an interesting turn. As far as the Olympians were concerned, she didn’t exist and she had been able to keep it that way but the Olympians had started making more frequent visits to the Nexus. Upon discovery of her existence the Olympians summoned her and her parents to Olympus.
  </p>
	<p id = "i">
    At first her parents denied that she was their child insisting that the black wings must mean she is a daughter of Thanatos or Nemesis as neither of them have any demigod children. The Olympians saw straight through their lies and knew she was not a demigod. To prove this the Olympians ran a celestial blade dagger over her arm and when ichor spilled out instead of regular blood, it was confirmed that she was, in fact, immortal. However, with no way to prove that she was the daughter of Nyx and Erebus, and with her not telling the Olympians, they were unable to punish her parents and instead placed all the punishment on her. 
  </p>
  <p id = "i">
    They stripped her of most of her immortality, she had the same kind of immortality as a Hunter of Artemis: living forever unless killed in combat, not aging, and not getting sick. She was not confined to the camp however it felt like she was as her wings prevented her from being able to fit in with humans. The gods charged her with taking care of their children as the new Camp Director of the Nexus Camp Halfblood Section.
  </p>
  <p><b>Extra Backstory:</b></p>
  <p id = "i">
    She was born in the Mansion of Night and has spent most of her life in Tartarus. In the first few years of her life she developed her powers and learned how to fight. After a while it got boring, there’s only so many times you can explore Tartarus by flying around before it gets mundane.That, and there's only so many times you can tell a spirit of fear to shove off before it stops taking you seriously. Bored by the shadows and perpetual darkness, and tired of killing monsters just to get around safely, Deyanira started researching ways to get out of this place - she had heard that there were ways for deities to manifest outside of their physical realm, although those techniques were rumored to be taught from mother to daughter, from father to son - not learned. 
  </p>
  <p id = "i">
    Unwilling to tell her parents where she was going, Deyanira finally decided to go up on her own to the surface, instead of projecting herself through the realms - albeit a harder thing to do, and riskier, but doable without any secret knowledge of the sort. It took her a few tries until she could do this quickly and efficiently - only to be promptly found out by her father, who effectively grounded her and reminded her that if he caught her doing this again, she would be punished appropriately. She would instead sneak away to visit the humans via the Labyrinth, an untraceable way to escape and travel through realms, even by the gods. Visiting the humans was intriguing, but after a while, Deyanira became bored with simply visiting and began to take part in human life at the time, although it became harder for her to stay hidden because of her frequent appearances in the long passage of time - some regarded her as a time traveler, which wasn't exactly wrong, but they began to suspect her as more than human although none saw her leave or disappear and move through worlds. 
  </p>
  <p id = "i">
    During her first visit through the Labyrinth, she exited the Labyrinth in the middle of the Hunter’s campsite. Of course seeing an intruder appear from nowhere got the Hunter’s attention and came at her with their knives at first. She did her best to not injure the hunters as she made space so she could get off the ground. Once she had enough space, she took off into the sky, her wounds dripping ichor onto the ground where she had stood. As she flew away, the Hunter’s Lieutenant, Arcadia, had just enough time to fire an arrow at Deyanira, which embedded itself just at the base of her left wing. This injury was enough to knock her out of the sky. Arcadia, seeing the Ichor on the ground, got help from Artemis to track down the fallen goddess in the forest. 
  </p>
  <p id = "i">
    Leaving the rest of the Hunter’s at camp, Arcadia and Artemis ventured into the forest in the general direction Deyanira had flown in. When they found her, they pointed their weapons at her, demanding to know who she was and what her intentions were. Deyanira brought a solid wall of shadow up between her and them, hoping to prevent further injury, but when she realized she could not get the arrow out herself and that she was too weak to shadow away, she had to figure out some way out of this. Knowing that there would be consequences for her if the other Olympians knew about her, she begged Artemis to not tell anyone that she had seen her. After Artemis swore on the Styx that she wouldn’t tell, she let the wall fall. 
  </p>
  <p id = "i">
    Looking defeated, the young goddess stated that she had no intentions of harming anyone. She refused to tell them who her parents were and why she was a goddess but she did reveal her name. She went with the Lieutenant and Lady Artemis back to the Hunter’s camp where they fixed her injuries, and helped her regain her strength. At full strength once again, Deyanira stayed with the hunters for a bit, accompanying them on hunts before having to return back to Tartarus so as to not alert her parents to her disappearance.
  </p>
  <p id = "i">
    During her next few visits, Deyanira would always set off to find the Hunters if she was able to. Becoming close friends with Arcadia, eventually revealing her parenthood only to her, and at one point debating whether or not to take the oath of maidenhood and stay with the hunters permanently. 
  </p>
  <p id = "i">
    One of these times, the hunters were staying at Camp Halfblood for a bit while Lady Artemis was on a solo hunt. The hunters of course had their usual game of Capture the Flag with the campers which Deyanira had joined in on with the Hunters. She had to be careful to not get injured but of course one of the campers clipped her arm with their sword. Acting quickly, Deyanira placed a mist illusion over the area, making her blood appear as red rather than gold. 
  </p>
  <p id = "i">
    When Lady Artemis reunited with the hunters and they left Camp Halfblood, Deyanira stayed behind to help train some of the new demigods that arrived at camp. Although her visits to camp were few and far between, she became an important part of the camp structure. No one knew where she would disappear off to for years at a time, but with a Labyrinth entrance always nearby even when the camp would change locations, Deyanira would always find her way back.
