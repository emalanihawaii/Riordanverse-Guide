  <h3>New Camp Half Blood</h3>
  <p>Camp Half-Blood is a Greek demigod training facility that was originally located on the north shore of Long Island before it was rebuilt in The Nexus. The camp is divided into 20 Cabins dedicated to each of the Greek Gods and Goddesses of the Pantheon. When you’re claimed by your Godly Parent you’re then a part of that cabin. Each cabin has a cabin leader that runs the cabins and represents their brothers and sisters. There are many different activities at camp involving extra curricular as well as training. Campers can eat at the dining pavilion where there are tables set for each of the gods as well. There is also an archery field, a sword fighting arena, a climbing wall with lava for training, an amphitheater, stables, an armory, and the Big House where meetings are normally held.</p>

  <h3>The Original Camp Half Blood</h3>
  <p>Camp Half-Blood is a Greek demigod training facility located on the north shore of Long Island. The camp is directed by the god Dionysus, who the campers call "Mr. D," and Chiron, a Centaur who is the activities director. It is also the Greek counterpart of Camp Jupiter, a Roman camp in San Francisco, California.</p>
  <br>
  <p>The camp has magical borders which are enforced by the Golden Fleece, retrieved by the satyr Grover Underwood, the Cyclops Tyson, and demigods Percy Jackson, Clarisse La Rue, and Annabeth Chase. Stolen from Polyphemus' island, it was placed on Thalia's pine tree, ensuring that no monster could get into camp. The Fleece stays on the tree, guarded by the dragon Peleus, its magical powers protecting the camp from monsters and invaders.</p>
  <br>
  <p>The camp is described as being the only safe place for half-bloods, although in The Heroes of Olympus series it is revealed that there is a similar camp for Roman demigods – Camp Jupiter, located in San Francisco.</p>
  <br>
  <p>The half-bloods live in cabins (one for each of the twelve Olympians; later, many more cabins were added for minor gods and goddesses after Percy's request in The Last Olympian), and eat at the dining pavilion. There is also an archery field, a sword fighting arena, a climbing wall with lava for training, an amphitheater, stables, an armory, and the Big House.</p>
  <br>
  <p>The camp's cover name is Delphi Strawberry Service, a reference to the name of the Oracle of Delphi.</p>

  <h3>Greek Gods</h3>
  <p>This article is about the pantheon of gods. You may be looking for the book, Percy Jackson's Greek Gods.</p>
  <br>
  <p>The Greek Gods are a race of immortal beings who control the forces of nature and human endeavors. The majority are the descendants and relatives of the Elder Titans, their chief enemies. There are currently twelve major gods, the Olympians, who rule over the universe, all of whom are under the rule of Zeus. There are many other minor gods who serve smaller but necessary purposes in the world.</p>
  <br>
  <p>The six elder Greek gods and goddesses were Hestia, Demeter, Hera, Hades, Poseidon and Zeus, because they were the sons and daughters of the two rulers of the Titans: Kronos and Rhea.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Fearing his children would overthrow him in the same way he had done to his own father like Ouranos had predicted, Kronos devoured his first two sons and his three daughters almost immediately after they were born. Hestia first, then Demeter, Hera, Hades, and Poseidon. He would have devoured Zeus as well, but Rhea, unable to bear the pain of losing another child and seeing her husband now for the monster he was, entered into an alliance with Gaea, who smuggled her son away to safety, and gave her husband a rock instead to devour in which he ate without looking.</p>
  <br>
  <p>The Olympians have been challenged many times for their control of the world, but they have always managed to stabilize their rule, often with the help of their children, the demigods. This is exemplified when the Giants rebelled against the gods, and Hercules and Dionysus, the sons of Zeus, helped them vanquish the Giants as the giants could be killed easily if they are fought with the help of a demigod.</p>

  <h3>Operation</h3>
  <p>Like the Romans, the Greeks have demigod children and a camp to train them. Unlike the Romans they have some involvement in the demigod's lives not being so much a stickler for rules like their Roman counterparts. They can also walk the mortal world without a host.</p>

  <h3>Divine Form</h3>
  <p>Gods as well as most other immortal beings, in their natural, fully empowered form, are radiant with a divine light so intense that no being less than a god can look upon it without disintegrating to ashes. To interact with mortals and heroes, the gods take on a lesser form which can be safely observed. Gods can instantly call back this power any time they desire, and may even revert involuntarily to their Divine Form if experiencing intense emotions. According to Hephaestus, the only time a god’s full essence and power is ever in one place is when they are in their Divine Form. They have eternal youth and the ability to control their physical age. They are all stunning and beautiful in their own right, though they can sustain irregularities from severe injury (such as Hephaestus).</p>

<div class = "cat">
  <h3>Divine Laws</h3>
  <p>Despite their immense power, gods are bound by laws and oaths sworn upon the River Styx. However, due to their immortal nature, breaking such oaths doesn't have severe consequences to them most of the time, although it may have consequences on people they care or cared about.</p>
  <br>
  <p><b>No god</b> can enter the domain of another unless invited by the lord/lady of said domain unless their domain overlaps. The only known gods to freely travel the worlds are Hermes and Iris, both of which are the messenger deities.</p>
  <br>
  <p><b>No god</b> can directly steal the symbol of power of another. This applies to both the Titans and Olympians. As mortals and demigods are free from this rule, this is the reason why Zeus knew a hero or mortal had stolen his Master Bolt.</p>
  <br>
  <p><b>Gods</b> are limited to how much they can interfere in mortal affairs. This rule is a decree of Zeus, so it depends on how much he enforces it or knows about it. Some gods have violated this rule without incurring any punishment, such as Apollo in The Titan's Curse or Hera in The Battle of the Labyrinth.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Immortals can only fight demigods after being challenged or attacked first. However, Titans have been shown to ignore this rule as Kronos and Hyperion both attacked Percy first in The Last Olympian. It is likely, though, that this rule isn't compulsory.</p>
  <br>
  <p><b>The Big Three</b> were banned from having children after World War II as any one of their children would be responsible for the Great Prophecy. Zeus broke it by siring Thalia and Jason Grace, and Poseidon followed suit by having Percy Jackson. Hades was the only god of the Big Three to keep true to his oath, as his two youngest children, Bianca and Nico di Angelo were already born before the oath was made. This rule was dissolved at the end of The Last Olympian at Percy's request for he had fulfilled the prophecy.</p>

  <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
  <p>A god can survive a lack of worship or loss of their domain so long as their will to live is strong enough. Otherwise, they will fade. However, even if their will is strong enough they won't be powerful enough to maintain a physical form, as Kronos was able to survive, due to sheer willpower, yet remain powerless in Tartarus. If their thrones (or other sources of power) are destroyed, they will also fade along with it or become so weakened that they can no longer take a physical form.</p>

  <h3>Geography and Greece in the Modern World</h3>
  <p>Greece, officially the Hellenic Republic and historically Hellas (or the Republic of Greece in English), is a country in Europe. It consists of a mainland, the Peloponnese Peninsula, and over 2,000 islands. Although geographically located at the continent's southeast, it is generally included in Western Europe. Greece has land borders with Albania, the Republic of Macedonia and Bulgaria to the north, and Turkey to the east. The Aegean Sea lies to the east of mainland Greece, the Ionian Sea to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. Athens is the capital and the largest city in the country. Eighty percent of Greece consists of mountains or hills, making the country one of the most mountainous in Europe. Mount Olympus, the mythical abode of the gods, culminates at Mytikas peak 2,917 m (9,570 ft), the highest in the country.</p>

  <h3>Mount Olympus</h3>
  <p>In Greek mythology, Olympus was regarded as the "home" of the Olympian gods of the Ancient Greek world. It formed itself after the gods defeated the Titans, their parents, in the Titan War, and soon the palace was inhabited by the gods. It is the setting of many Greek mythical stories, including Percy Jackson and The Olympians series. In Percy Jackson and the Olympians, it is the Empire State Building, since it is one of the tallest in America, and symbolically one of the most important. Mount Olympus was not shaken by winds, nor ever wet with rain. Snow had not fallen upon it, the air is outspread clear and cloudless, and over it hovered a radiant whiteness. Since it is like this, it might be the reason the Greeks chose this mountain as the "home of the gods."</p>
  <br>
  <p><b>Greece</b> was where Western Civilization was born, and it means that all civilizations after it had a piece of its culture. It is mentioned many times throughout the series and is considered the first home of the Olympians. As Western Civilization centered itself in other nations, the gods moved with along with it. In one instance, the gods also changed their names, appearances, and personalities to suit the nation Western Civilization's flame had settled in. Mount Olympus is moved to be placed over the Empire State Building in New York City, and Mount Othrys is moved to be placed over Mount Tamalpais. Greece is the original home of Mount Olympus, the home of the Olympians, and of Mount Othrys, the home of the Titans.</p>
